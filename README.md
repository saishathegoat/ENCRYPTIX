I created a number guessing game in Java in which the player attempts to predict a randomly generated number within a given range.
The program gives feedback on whether the guessed number is too high or too low, allowing the player to narrow down their guesses.
The game continues until the proper number is guessed, after which the application congratulates the player and displays the number of attempts made.
In this project, we implemented control structures, generated random numbers, and handled user input in Java.
