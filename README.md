Welcome to the repository showcasing the Java projects I developed during my internship at Encryptix. This repository contains three distinct projects: the Number Game, Grade Calculator, and ATM Interface. Below, I provide a brief overview of each project, including the key functionalities and the methods used.

Projects Overview - 

1. Number Game
The Number Game is an interactive console-based game where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

Features:
Random number generation.
User input for guessing the number.
Feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Loop to allow multiple attempts until the correct number is guessed.


2. Grade Calculator
The Grade Calculator is a console-based application that calculates and displays the final grade for a student based on various assessment scores.

Features:
Input for different assessment scores.
Calculation of the final grade based on weighted averages.
Display of the final grade.


3. ATM Interface
The ATM Interface is a simulation of an ATM system, allowing users to perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money.

Features:
Balance inquiry.
Money deposit and withdrawal.
